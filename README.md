# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Along with unit tests for mocking the api request, I've used `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com` as a mock endpoint which echos the given score.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
npm start # http://localhost:3000
npm test
npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false
```
